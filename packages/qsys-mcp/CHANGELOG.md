# Changelog

All notable changes to qsys-mcp are documented here.
The format follows [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/), and
this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [Unreleased]

### Fixed

- `serverInfo.version` now reflects the package version (was hardcoded `0.1.0`
  since the first release).

## [0.3.0] - 2026-07-03

### Changed

- **Renamed on npm: `q-sys-mcp` → `qsys-mcp`** — the package name now matches
  the installed command. The old name was unpublished from the registry;
  update MCP configs from `npx -y q-sys-mcp` to `npx -y qsys-mcp`.
  (Versions ≤0.2.0 shipped as `q-sys-mcp`; npm's punctuation-similarity rule
  originally forced the hyphenated name and blocks owning both.)
- Now published from the [`qsys-tools`](https://github.com/reowens/qsys-tools)
  monorepo; the standalone `reowens/qsys-mcp` repo is retired. Depends on the
  published `qsys-qrc` (^0.1.0) instead of the workspace-internal copy.

## [0.2.0] - 2026-06-30

### Added

- Transparent auto-reconnect. On an unexpected socket drop (Core restart,
  leaving Emulate mode, a network blip) the client re-dials with exponential
  backoff and replays its logon + change-group registrations, so polling resumes
  without re-calling `qsys_connect`. In-flight and subsequent requests wait for
  the reconnect and retry once — drops are transparent to callers. On by
  default; opt out per connection with `reconnect: false` on `qsys_connect`.
- Snapshot tools: `qsys_load_snapshot` (`Snapshot.Load`, optional ramp) and
  `qsys_save_snapshot` (`Snapshot.Save`) for recalling and capturing control
  scenes by bank name + snapshot number.
- Change-group lifecycle is now complete: `qsys_change_group_remove`
  (`ChangeGroup.Remove`), `qsys_change_group_clear` (`ChangeGroup.Clear`), and
  `qsys_change_group_invalidate` (`ChangeGroup.Invalidate`, force a full resend
  on the next poll — handy after a reconnect). 13 tools → 18.

### Changed

- Richer package description + expanded npm keywords, and added GitHub repo
  description + topics, for search and discoverability.

## [0.1.1] - 2026-06-22

### Changed

- No functional changes. First release cut through the GitHub Actions
  trusted-publishing pipeline (OIDC, no token) — published with build
  provenance. `0.1.0` was a manual bootstrap publish.

## [0.1.0] - 2026-06-22

### Added

- Initial release: an MCP server that controls Q-SYS over the QRC protocol
  (JSON-RPC 2.0 over TCP 1710), pointed at a real Core or at Q-SYS Designer in
  Emulate mode.
- 13 tools — connect, status, component/control discovery, get/set for both
  Named Controls and component controls (with ramps), change groups
  (create / poll / add-component / destroy), and disconnect.
- Response shaping (`filter`, `names_only`, `type`) to keep large designs from
  flooding an agent's context.
- Live-Core write warning and a 30 s NoOp keepalive.
- Cross-platform CI (Linux / macOS / Windows × Node 18 & 20) with a
  hardware-free test suite (mock QRC + in-memory MCP transport).
